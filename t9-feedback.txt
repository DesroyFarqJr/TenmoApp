- The @RequestBody class "Transfer" seems to contain an excessive
amount of information. In theory, it only requires 2 properties, 
the amount, and the id (or username) of the person we're sending it
to. 

If you need all those properties for something else later on, then
I suggest making a TransferDTO class with only those 2 fields I just
mentioned.

- On the /transfer endpoint, everything is setup so that it returns a 
String. This is a bit strange, a better approach would have been to
maybe return the new balance following the transfer.
